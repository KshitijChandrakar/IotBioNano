### Various Nanonetworks Exist
Human, Plant and Bacterial

1. Human: 3 Types of Communcation Signaling
- Among Cells
    - Juxtacrine (Cells in contact with other Cells)
    - Paracrine (In Vicinity)
    - Endocrine (Far Away)

2. Bacterial 
THESE ARE SO FUCKING COOL?
ok like they make waves of pottasium when the colony is starved and then the waves reach the border of the colony and tells it to stop growing cause no food like damn

3. Theres also Plant Bionetworks which in of themselves are incredibly cool but not relevant enough for this project, read up on it later though.
