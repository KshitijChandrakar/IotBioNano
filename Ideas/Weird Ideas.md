- So Imagine if There's a Web of IoMT devices and According to that we can have Ambulances and Stuff Stations Efficiently with Some Algorithm
- Better fucking Regulation Oml? like have laws for this otherwise its just a straight road to dystopia.
-   The IoT suffers from [platform fragmentation](zim://ada09bae-8e7e-547b-35ba-f75e9ca2af8c.zim/A/Platform_fragmentation "Platform fragmentation"), lack of interoperability and common [technical standards](zim://ada09bae-8e7e-547b-35ba-f75e9ca2af8c.zim/A/Technical_standard "Technical standard") [Wikipedia Internet Of Things] 
	- Like Same for Multiple Types of Histopathology Scans and Stuff. Simply a Nightmare to work with, Standardise it somehow?

- Ok so maybe they're only using Plant and animal based Nanotech rn but what if there was also fungus based nanotech that'd be so cool
- Right so, One of the ways of molecular communication is through the concentration of certain molecules. cant use EM communication cause its too big and Nanotech is smol. but why aren't there like, swarm computers? as in computers which are made of smaller computers, like ant's ki descision making, also what would be the limit of computing for such a computer, like would Moore's Law and stuff like that apply here? Gotta look into it more, could be very possible that I just havent read about it yet
- same as above, however just using nanomachines would probably be inefficient, so best most likely would be a hybrid between a bigger machine and a swarm of nanomachines working together
