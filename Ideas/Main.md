Main challenges are 
1. communication methods
    - cant use EM based solutions cause the size is too small also they dont perform well in the IoBNT environment
    - Molecular communication is promising as it is already used by Natural BNT
2. how to interface between the body and the machine
- we can use Thz based methods
- theres Redox, Optogenetics and Flurorescence based techniques
3. theres also the problem of how to handle the large about of data generated
4. How store energy? 
5. how coexist with complex human biological systems
6. also security and privacy
