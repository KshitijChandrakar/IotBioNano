    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>There have been many advancements in the area of Nanotechnology and Biotechnology, leading to improvements in its Internet of Things (IOT) applications, With new Ideas every day on the horizon the boundaries of nanotechnology shift rapidly.</p>
    <p>One of the major reasons for progress and study in this field is the preexisting natural framework of Bio-NanoThings (BNTs), Which offers a solid foundation for modelling artificial Nanonetworks.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <p><strong>Nanonetworks</strong>, composed of components at the nanometer scale, are independently operating fully-featured devices theoretically capable of all tasks their Macro-Scale counterparts are, such as data-storage, sensing and actuation. However, Tat such a small scale, individual devices provide us with scarce capabilities, leading to the establishment of Nanonetworks.[2]</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Several of these are naturally occuring all of which have their own complexity and applications in Internet of Bio-NanoThings (IoBNT), and are reviewed in this paper. The ones proven to be useful for IoBNT applications are</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Mammalian Nervous systems [1]</li>
          <li>Bacterial Networks</li>
          <li>Plant and Fungal Networks</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>For the creation of any network, as with a Nanonetwork, a few requirements must be met, Namely: Communication between Individual Nodes, and Storage of Energy. In a biological environment, we must also make sure of compaitability with preexisting biological systems. To fulfill the techincal challenges some of the solutions proposed are:</p>
    <ol>
      <li>
        <p>Communication and Interfacting Methods</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Developing better communication methods is one of the foremost technical challenges to be overcome, as conventional communication methods like Electromagnetic Transmission cannot be used at the Nano-Scale due to the size and energy constraints.</li>
          <li>
            <p>The following technologies have emerged as the leading techniques for Communication</p>
            <ul>
              <li>Molecular communication: it is already used by Natural BNT in an incredibly Energy Efficient Manner</li>
              <li>High Frequency EM based methods: While conventional EM methods are not possible at the Nano-Scale, Graphene-Based antennas allow us to use the terahertz bands, proving promising for the high operating frequencies of BNTs</li>
              <li>Acoustic Communication: Ultrasonic Communication has been considered because of its advantages over its RF counterparts inside a fluidic environment like the human body.</li>
              <li>Optical based methods: FÂ¨orster Resonance Energy Transfer (FRET) is non-radiative, high-rate energy transfer between fluorescent molecules, which promises a High rate of energy transfer in the order of Mbps.</li>
              <li>There are various other techniques as in Redox, Optogenetics and Fluorescence based techniques</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>How store energy?</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>how coexist with complex human biological systems</p>
      </li>
    </ol>
    <p>We provide a comprehensive review of the these problems in a later section, along with a brief overview of the previously existing framework of BNTs. However, along with the technical challenges there are many social challenges to overcome which are also discussed.</p>
